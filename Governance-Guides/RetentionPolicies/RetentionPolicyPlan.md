# Retention Policy Plan for SharePoint Online

## 🎯 Objective
To retain critical documents for compliance while ensuring unused data is deleted to reduce clutter.

## 🔍 Policy Types
- Retain-only: Preserve documents for a defined period
- Retain-then-delete: Auto-delete after retention
- Event-based: Triggered by specific events (e.g., contract expiration)

## 💡 Best Practices
- Use Microsoft Purview to apply retention at site, folder, or item level
- Avoid overlapping policies on the same content
- Communicate policies to end users

## 📋 Example
Apply a 7-year retention policy to all HR documents tagged as “employee-records”
